```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


```{r includes}

library(tidyverse)
library(here)

hosp_adm <- read_csv("data_raw/hospital_admissions.csv")
pop_data <- read_csv("data_raw/population_demographics.csv")

```
## Join Datasets

From the two datasets we want to know about patients who were admitted. Therefore need all the data from hosp_adm and only the matching rows from pop_data.
Left join would do this but there is a risk of missing data in the population data. Inner join will ensure we only process full data.


```{r}


df <- inner_join(hosp_adm, pop_data, by="id")

glimpse(df)

```
